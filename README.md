### tl;dr
This is a very specific project, and if you're not looking at it for the purpose of evaluating my coding ability, then it won't interest you

### Summary
I've been working on this project since about June of 2016. It's my first experience building a server from the ground up, and I've learned a lot along the way. I'm using Nodejs for the backend coupled with a MongoDB database. Front-end files are rendered by jade and preprocessed with less (for HTML and CSS, respectively). My front end is pretty plain; I started with pretty basic functionality, using only jQuery, and it's just stayed that way.
